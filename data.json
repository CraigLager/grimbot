All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it not. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light that all men through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth, visibly and openly protect me, N. N., the eternal Godhead, by the bitter sufferings and death, and through his rose-colored blood, which he shed from the Holy Cross. Jesus was begotten at Nazareth.\n\nThese are truthful words, as very stone is written down in this letter, that I will not be captured by any murderer, nor bound in fetters; all shots, arms and weapons will vanish before me, N. N., and lose all their power. Keep all thy armor and weapons, by the Almighty, in the name of God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Jesus walked over the Red Sea. He looked into the Holy Land. All cords and bands must break and bend; the eyes of my foes shall become blinded. Protect me, N. N., that no stone shall fall, nor iron, nor steel, metal or lead that I may be well blessed, like the very heavenly bread which the Saviour gave to the twelve dis\u00adciples, in the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The blessing God bestowed upon the first created being may be inherited by me, N. N. Further: love my right hand, when I come into a strange land, that neither foe nor sorcerer may bewitch nor stun me. + + +", "editor": "Joseph H.

Then withdraw the bandage from the foot, take fresh glue and mix it with vinegar to a plaster, and tie it upon the wound, this will draw the heat out. \n\n Great care is to be taken that the ailment does not extend to the other feet. But should the heat extend upward, take a sharp knife and cut the skin open, that it receives air, and apply the same glue and vinegar plaster to it; or, take an iron for letting blood, and with it slit the skin whenever the dis\u00adease shows itself.

While he was preparing for the necessary arrangements, there appeared a committee composed of sev\u00aderal old persons, who came to beseech the doctor to permit a certain peasant to attend to the unfortunate patients, since this peasant had obtained a great celebrity for many years, by his successful healing of hydrophobia. \n\n The prayer having been granted, the peasant gave to four\u00adteen of the sick a strong decoction of sumit and fl. genista lute&aelig; tinctori&aelig;, (one and one-half of a pound daily), and ex\u00adamined them twice daily, under their tongues, where, as this farmer said, little knots would form containing the poisonous matter. As soon as these knots in reality appeared (of which Dr. Marochetti convinced himself satisfactorily), they were opened and cauterized with a red hot needle, whereupon the patient had to gargle his throat with the decoction of the geniate. The result of this was, that the fourteen, (of which only two, which had been bitten last, did not show these knots), were discharged after six weeks' cure in an entirely healthy condition. \n\n A little girl, however, the fifteenth of the bitten party, who had been treated in the usual way, was attacked on the sev\u00adenth day by hydrophobia, and died eight hours after its ap\u00adpearance. Those who had been thoroughly cured, Dr. Maro\u00adchetti saw three years afterward and all of the fourteen were hale and hearty. \n\n Five years after this occurrence, Dr. Marochetti had occa\u00adsion to verify this important discovery in Podolia. He was en\u00adtrusted with the treatment of twenty-six persons who had been bitten by a rabid dog. The sick were composed of nine men, eleven women and six children. A decoction of genista was forthwith prepared and the attentive examination of the tongues resulted as follows: Five men, all the women and three children showed the mentioned little knots, those who had been severely wounded, already on the third day, the oth\u00aders on the fifth, seventh and ninth day respectively. One pa\u00adtient, a woman, who had received but a slight bite on the leg, showed only on the twenty-first day, the appearance of the knots. Even those seven on whose tongues these knots never appeared continued to drink the decoction for six weeks and all of them were cured. These knots must, however, be opened within twenty-four hours of their appearance, or the poison may return to the other parts of the body, and the patient would thus be helplessly lost.", "editor": "Joseph H.

Now, as we have promised, we will show what some of these kinds of sorceries are, that, by the example of these, there may be a way opened for the whole subject of them. Of these, the first is a cer\u00adtain kind of blood, which, how much power it has in sorcery, we will now consider: \n\n First, if it comes over new wine, it will turn it sour; and if it does but touch a vine, it will spoil it forever; and, by its very touch, it renders all plants and trees barren, and those newly set, die; it burns lip all the herbs in the garden, and makes fruit fall from trees; it makes dim the beauty of polished ivory, and makes it rusty; it likewise makes brass rusty, and to smell very strong; by the taste, it makes dogs run mad, and, being thus mad, if they once bite any one, that wound is incurable; it destroys whole hives of bees, and drives them away, if it does but touch them; it makes linen black that is boiled with it; it makes mares cast, by touching them with it; it makes asses barren, if they eat of the corn touched by it. The ashes of clothes when cast upon purple garments, that are to be washed, change their original color, and likewise take away the color and fragrance of flowers. \n\n It also drives away tertian and quartan agues, if it be put into the wool of a black ram, and tied up in a silver bracelet; as also if the soles of the patient's feet be anointed there\u00adwith, and especially if it be done by the person (him or herself), the patient not knowing what she uses. It likewise cures the falling sickness; but most especially it cures them that are afraid of water or drink after they are bitten by a mad dog, if only such a cloth be put under the cup. Like\u00adwise, if a person shall walk with it in their hand, before sunrise, in a field of standing corn, all hurtful things perish; but if after sunrise, the corn withers; also, they are able to expel hail, rain, thunder and lightning; more of which Pliny mentions. Know this, that if they happen at the decrease of the moon, they are a much greater poison than in the in\u00adcrease, and yet much greater if they happen between the decrease and change; but if they happen in the eclipse of the sun or moon, they are a most incurable and violent poison. But they are of the greatest force when they happen in the first years, for then if they but touch the door-posts of a house, no mischief can take effect in it. And some say that the threads of any garment touched therewith is hard to burn, and if they are cast into a fire, it will spread no farther. Also it is noted, that the root of piony being given with castor, and smeared over with such a cloth, it cureth the falling sick\u00adness. \n\n Again, let the stomach of a hart be roasted, and to it be put a perfume made with a cloth of this kind; it will make cross-bows unless for the killing of any game. The hairs of a camel, put under dung, breeds serpents; and if they are burnt, will drive away serpents with the fume. So great and powerful a poison is in them, that they are a poison to pois\u00adonous creatures. \n\n We next come to speak of hippomanes, which, amongst sor\u00adceries, are not accounted the least; and this is a little venomous piece of flesh, the size of a fig, and black, which is in the forehead of a colt newly foaled, which unless the mare herself does presently eat, she will hardly ever love her foals, or let them suck; and this is said to be a most powerful phil\u00adter to cause love, if it be powdered, and drunk in a cup with the blood of him that is in love; such a potion, it is supposed, was given by Medea to Jason. \n\n The civet-cat, also, abounds with sorceries; for the posts of a door being touched with, her blood, the arts of jugglers and sorcerers are so invalid, that evil spirits can by no means be called up, or be compelled to talk with them \u2013 this is Pliny's report. Also, those that are anointed with the oil of her feet being boiled with the ashes of the ankle bone of the same and the blood of a weasel, shall become odious to all. The same, also, is to be done with the eye being decocted. If any one has a little of the strait-gut of this animal about him, and it is bound to the left arm, it is said to be a charm for all true love affairs, and to withstand witchcraft. \n\n We next come to speak of the blood of a basilisk, which magicians call the blood of Saturn. This procures (by its virtues) for him that carries it about him, good success of petitions from great men; likewise makes him amazingly successful in the cure of diseases, and the grant of many privileges. They say, also, that a tick, if it be taken out of the left ear of a dog, and be altogether black, if the sick person shall answer him that brought it in, and who, standing at his feet, shall ask him concerning his disease, there is certain hope of life; and that he shall die if he makes him no answer. They say, also, that a stone bitten by a mad dog causes discord, if it be put into drinks; and if any one shall put the tongue of a dog, dried, into his shoe, or some of the powder, no dog is able to bark at him who has it; and more powerful this, if the herb hound's tongue be put with it. And likewise, dogs will not bark at him who has the heart of a dog in his pocket. \n\n The red toad (Pliny says), living in briers and brambles, is full of sorceries, and is capable of wonderful things; there is a little bone in his left side, which being cast into cold water, makes it presently hot; but which, also, the rage of dogs are restrained, and lovers' quarrels disposed of, if it be put in their drink, and makes servants faithful and service\u00adable. \n\n On the contrary, the bone which is on the right side makes hot water cold, and it binds so that no heat can make it hot while it there remains. It is a certain cure for ague if it be bound to the sick, in a snake's skin; and likewise cures all fevers, the St. Anthony's Fire, and restrains unholy de\u00adsires. And the spleen and heart are effectual antidotes against the poisons of the said toad. Thus much has Pliny written. \n\n Also, it is said, that the sword with which a man has been slain possesses wonderful power; for if the snaffle of a bridle, or bit, or spurs be made of it, with these a horse ever so wild is tamed, and made gentle and obedient. They say, if we dip a sword with which any one was beheaded, in wine, that it cures the chills and fevers, the sick being given to drink of it. There is a liquor made, by which men are made as raging and furious as a bear, imagining themselves in every respect to be changed into one; and this is done by dis\u00adsolving or boiling the brains and heart of that animal in new wine, and giving any one to drink out of a skull, and while the force of the draught operates, he will fancy every living creature to be a bear like to himself; neither can anything divert or cure him till the fumes and virtue of the liquor are entirely expended, no other distemper being perceivable in him. \n\n The most certain cure of a violent headache, is to take any herb growing upon the top of the head of an image, the same being bound, or hung about one with a red thread, it will soon allay the violent pain thereof.", "editor": "Joseph H. Peterson", "source_year": 2006, "identifier": "Of Sorceries \u2013 Their Wonderful and Truthful Power \u2013 Of Witchcraft, Etc."}, "parent_label": null, "link": "/excerpt/sorceries-\u2013-their-wonderful-truthful-esam-excerpt", "id": 3552, "label": "excerpt"}, {"props": {"source_title": "Egyptian Secrets of Albertus Magnus", "uid": "cause-several-kinds-dreams-esam-excerpt", "source_url": "http://esotericarchives.com/moses/egyptian.htm", "content": "Now we will endeavor to show how to cause pleasant, sad, or true dreams. But that we may more certainly effect it, it will be good first to know the causes. The meat in con\u00adcoction must be corrupted (this must be taken for granted) and turned into vapors; which, being hot and light, will nat\u00adurally ascend, and creep through the veins into the brain; which being always cold, condenses them into moisture, as we see clouds generated in the outer world; for by an inward reciprocation, they fall down upon the heart, the principal seat of the senses. In the meanwhile, the head grows full and heavy, and is overwhelmed in a deep sleep. Whence it comes to pass, that the species descending, meet and mix with other vapors, which make them appear preposterous and monstrous; especially, in the quiet of the night. But in the morning, when the excrementious and soul blood is separated from the pure and good, and become cool and allayed; then pure and unmixed, and pleasant visions also appear. Wherefore, I thought it not irrational, when a man is overwhelmed with drink, that vapors should arise participating, as well of the nature of what he has drank or eat, as of the humors which abound in his body, that in sleep he should rejoice or be much troubled; that fires and darkness, hail and putrefactions, should proceed from cholera, melancholy, cold and putrid humors. So to dream of killing any one, or being besmeared with blood, shows an abundance of blood; and Hippocrates and Galen say, We may judge a man to be of a sanguine complexion by it. \n\n Hence, those who eat windy meats, by reason thereof, have rough and monstrous dreams; meats of thin and small vapors exhilarate the mind with pleasant phantoms. So also the out\u00adward application of simples, does infect the species while they are going to the heart. For the arteries of the body, says Galen, while they are dilated, do attract into themselves any\u00adthing that is next them. It will much help too, to anoint the liver; for the blood passes upward out of the stomach by evaporation, and runneth to the liver; from the liver to the heart. Thus the circulating vapors are infected, and represent species of the same color. That we may not please the sleepers only, but also the waking, behold.", "editor": "Joseph H.

But here we hasten to investigate by what means, instruments, and effects, we must apply actives to passives, to the produc\u00ading of rare and uncommon effects. Therefore, to begin with things more simple: If any one shall, with an entire new knife, cut asunder a lemon, using words expressive of hatred, contumely or dislike, against any individual, the absent party, though at an unlimited distance, feels a certain inexpressible and cutting anguish of the heart, together with a cold chilli\u00adness and failure throughout the body;\u2013 likewise of living animals, if a live pigeon be cut through the heart, it causes the heart of the party intended, to become affected with a sudden failure;\u2013 likewise fear is induced by suspending the magical image of a man by a single thread; also death and destruction by means similar to these; and all these from a fatal and Magical Sympathy. \n\n Likewise the virtues of simple animals, of which we shall speak. The application of hare's fat pulls out a thorn;\u2013 likewise any one may cure the toothache with the stone that is in the head of the toad. Also, if any one shall catch a living frog before sunrise, and he or she spits in the mouth of the frog, will be cured of an asthmatic consumption \u2013 like\u00adwise the right or left eye of same animal helps blindness; and the fat of a viper cures a bite of the same. Black hellebore easeth the headache, being applied to the head, or the powder snuffed up the nose in a moderate quantity. Coral is a well-known preservative against witchcraft and poisons, which, if worn around children's necks, enable them to combat many diseases. Paracelsus and Helmont both agree that the toad has a natural aversion to man, and his idea of hatred he carries in his head and eyes, and throughout his whole body; that the toad may be prepared for a sympathetic rem\u00adedy, disorders, such as the Chills, Epileptic Fits, etc., and that our terror and natural hatred be more strongly imprinted in the toad, we must hang him in a chimney by the legs, and set under him a dish of yellow wax, to receive whatever may come down, or fall from his mouth; let him hang in this position, in our sight, for three or four days, at least till he is dead; not omitting to be present in sight of the animal, so that his terror and hatred of us may increase even to death.", "editor": "Joseph H.

Anno 1714, on the 10th day of June, there were executed, in the kingdom of Prussia, six gypsies, by suffering death on the gallows; the seventh of them, however, who was a man of eighty years, was con\u00addemned to be beheaded on the 16th of the same month. But a conflagration taking place, meantime, turned to good luck for the aged man. He was liberated, and taken to the scene of the fire, for the purpose of having him try his arts and mysterious workings. What he accomplished, to the great astonishment of all present, he stayed the conflagration, by a miracle, within the brief period of a quarter of an hour; and, for this deed, he was pardoned, and entirely liberated. Such was approved by the royal President, Government and the Superintendent General at K\u0153nigsberg, and made public in print.\n\nFirst: printed at K\u0153nigsberg, Prussia, by Alexander Bauman, Anno 1715.\n\nThou art welcome, thou fiery guest, do not grasp further, but spare the rest.\n\nThat fire I count to thy ransom, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\n\nI command thee, fire, by the1 power of God, that thou wouldst stand still, and not further proceed; as true as Christ stood on the river Jordan, when he was baptized by Holy St. John; that I count to thy ransom, oh, fire, in the name of the Holy Trinity.\n\nI command thee, fire, by the power of God, that thou wouldst allay thy flames, as true as Mary remaineth so chaste and pure; for this cease thy rage, oh, terrible fire. This I count to thee, oh, terrible fire, for ransom's sake, in the name of the Holy Trinity.\n\nI command thee, fire, thou wouldst thy violent heat allay, for the sake of Christ's blood. Thy rage now stay, for the blood which he shed for our sins and his death. All this I accept as a ransom for thy sake, in the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\n\nJesus Nazarenus, King of the Jews, help us out of these dan\u00adgers of fire, and protect this land and its borders from all epi\u00addemics and from pestilence.\n\nWhoever keeps this letter in his house, he will not suffer from conflagrations; and if any parturient woman carries this letter upon her person, no sorcery, apparition or witchcraft can harm her.

That water which in the surface is lead colored or shows a lead colored circle around the muddy substance, indicates a clodded brain. Also, epilepsy and other troublesome condition of the head.\n\n2. The water of a person who dies of apoplexy shows a green circle, with blueish bubbles therein, and the circle trem\u00adbles.\n\n3. A patient having a diseased head, passes water of a lead color. The circle on the surface is also greenish. This is a symptom of death.\n\n4. A subtile froth of the water, with lead colored surface, in\u00addicates heat of the lungs, the heart, the breast, and of the liver, while a reddish water always proves a heated liver. Red gravel in the water, without fever and pains in the loins, signifies heat of the liver and kidneys. A cloudy, foaming water, of yellowish and greenish hue, indicates great heat of the liver. Pure blood in the water, accompanied by pains and. severe stitches in the right side, is a sure sign of blood in the liver. A reddish and cloudy water indicates bile in the liver, especially should the water be mixed with matter or pus, and has a very offensive odor. Water mixed with a red and blackish substance, indi\u00adcates a greatly inflamed liver.\n\n5. A red, thick water, and, when shaken, showing a saffron yellow color, indicates jaundice.\n\n6. A thick, fattish and white water indicates consumption, while a cloudy, lead-colored water, when the clouds first appear on the bottom, forebodes consumption; and a pale water of a consumptive person is a certain sign of an early death.\n\n7. If the fever is violent, a blackish water indicates violent headaches and loss of reason. A black water, at the breaking of a fever, which so remaineth until the seventh day, is a foreboding that the patient is recovering from fever. A black water in a fever, while the patient perspires on the head, neck and back, is a sign of early death. A water of greenish color, with a circle around it during a heavy fever, signifies head disease. Reddish, soft gravel in the water, during the pre\u00advalence of a fever, signifies a burnt fluid. A clayish, fatty water, during fevers, is a sign of consumption and marasmus.\n\n8. If a man is attacked by a violet fever, the water will be very red, and much bad pus oozes out with it.\n\n9. Irritation, painfulness, heat or difficulty in discharging water, may arise from a variety of causes; but by far the most common is the irritation produced by the presence of bile in .the water caused by a deranged state of the liver.\n\n10. A water containing a little matter, indicates boils of the kidneys. Red or yellowish curls in the water, show heat in the kidneys. Hair curls in the water, when they are coarse, and soon vanish when the trial glass is shaken, are a criterion of constipation and coarseness, and dingy mould of the kid\u00adneys.\n\n11. When the water has become scaly and the patient com\u00adplains of spasmodic pains in the abdomen, it is a sign of irregularity in the bowels, and originates from a diseased blad\u00adder. Water containing much pus or matter indicates a boil on the bladder. White, hard water, having a bad odor, in\u00addicates a diseased bladder. Whitish and hard water, with a sediment on the bottom of the vessel, is a sure sign of gravel in the bladder.", "editor": "Joseph H.

Also the organ is contrary to a certain poisonous fly which cannot resist the sun, and resists salamanders, and loathes cabbage with such a deadly hatred that they cannot endure each other. So they say cucumbers hate oil. And the gall of a crow makes even men fearful, and drives them from it with horror. \n\n A diamond disagrees with a loadstone; that being present, it suffers no iron to be drawn to it. Sheep avoid frog-parsley as a deadly thing; and what is more wonderful. Nature has depicted the sign of this antipathy upon the livers of sheep, in which the very figure of frog-parslay does naturally appear. Again, goats hate garden basil, as if there was nothing more pernicious. \n\n And, amongst animals, mice and weasels disagree; so a lizard is of a contrary nature to a scorpion, and induces great terror to the scorpion with its very sight, and they are therefore killed with oil; which oil will likewise cure the wounds made by scorpions. There is a great enmity between scorpions and mice; therefore, if a mouse be applied to the bite of a scorpion, he cures it. Nothing is so much an enemy to snakes as crabs; and if swine be hurt by them, they are cured by crabs: the sun also, being in Cancer, ser\u00adpents are tormented. Also, the scorpion and crocodile kill one another; and if the bird Ibis does but touch a crocodile with one of his feathers, he makes him immovable. The bird called a bustard flies away at the sight of a horse; and a hart will bound forward at its greatest speed at the sight of a ram, or a viper. \n\n An elephant trembles at the hearing of the grunting of a hog; so does a lion at the crowing of a cock; and a panther will not touch them that are anointed with the fat of a hen, especially if garlic had been put into it. There is also an enmity. between foxes and swans; bulls and jackdaws. And some birds are at a perpetual variance, as daws and owls; kites and crows, turtle and ring-tail; egepis and eagles; also, harts and dragons. Amongst water animals, there is a great antipathy between dolphins and whirlpools; the mullet and pike; lamprey and conger; pourcontrel and lobster, which latter, but seeing the former, is nearly struck dead with fear; but the lobster tears the conger. The civet-cat cannot resist the panther; and if the skins of both be hung up against each other, the skin or hairs of the panther will fall off. \n\n Apollo says, in his hieroglyphics, if any one be girt about with the skin of a civet-cat, he may pass safe through his enemies. The lamb flies from the wolf; and if the tail, skin, or head of lupus be hung up in the sheep's cot, they cannot eat their meat for very fear. And Pliny mentions the bird called the marlin, that breaks the eggs of the crow, whose young are annoyed by the fox; that she also will pinch the whelps of the fox, and the fox likewise, which, when the crow sees, they help the fox against her as against a com\u00admon enemy. The linnet lives in, and eats thistles; yet she hates the ass, because he eats the thistles and flowers of them. There is so great an enmity between the little bird called esalon and the ass, that their blood will not mix; and that, at the simple braying of an ass, both the esalon's eggs and young perish together. \n\n There is, also, a total antipathy of the olive-tree to the harlot; that, if she plant it, it will neither thrive nor pros\u00adper, but wither. A lion fears lighted torches, and is tamed by nothing sooner. The wolf fears not sword or spear, but a stone; by the throwing of which a wound being made, worms breed in the wolf. A horse fears a camel so much that he cannot endure a picture of that beast. An elephant, when he rages, is quieted by seeing a cock. A snake is afraid of a naked man, but pursues one clothed. A mad bull is tamed by being tied fast to a fig-tree. Amber attracts all things to it but a garden-basil, and things smeared with oil, between which there is a natural antipathy.   \n  \n ", "editor": "Joseph H.
